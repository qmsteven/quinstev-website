<p>Hi, my name is Quinlan Stevenson! I am a fourth year student at <a href="https://lakeheadu.ca/about/orillia-campus">Lakehead University</a>.</p>
<h2>About me:</h2>

    <div class="text">
        <p>I grew up in a small town in southwestern Ontario called Stratford. I was born in the Stratford General Hospital but lived in Mitchell Ontario for the first 6 years of my life. I was enrolled in pre-kindergarten at the Perth Care For Kids and junior kindergarten at Upper Thames Elementary School. I then moved to Stratford to attend Bedford Public Elementary School for my senior kindergarten year. I was enrolled in French Immersion courses once I got into grade one and continued until I graduated from grade 12. After completing grade 6, I moved schools to go to Stratford Central Elementary School in 2012. I was there until I completed grade 8 in 2014. I then moved to Stratford Central Secondary School for grades 9 through 12, where I graduated in 2018, but decided to take a fifth year to hone my skills in Computer Science.</p>

        <p>I started at Georgian College in 2020, I learned front-end and app development. I learned how to code apps in Kotlin for Android devices and C#, C, C++, .NET and NodeJS for web development. This web app is coded in NodeJS! I learned a lot about what it means to be independent in an environment that was crippled by the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic. I met new friends, with much difficulty, and learned a lot of skills that will help me for the rest of my life.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I moved to Orillia and started my two years at Lakehead University's campus in Orillia. I learned about for software structures and how to use stacks and arrays. I loved the campus but the teachers left a lot to be desired. I worked a lot on some independent projects that furthered my learning about what I loved doing, creating websites and even began making websites for people!</p>
